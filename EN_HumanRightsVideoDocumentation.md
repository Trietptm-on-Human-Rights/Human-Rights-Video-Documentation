### 1. Be prepared
Plan what you want to capture and be prepared with the right equipment
before you pick up a camera. Consider what audience your video is for,
such as media, lawyers, or tribunals. Assess any risks to yourself,
those you film and the communities you are filming in.

### 2. Record date, time and location
To help news media, human rights organizations and courts verify your
video, set the correct date, time and GPS location on your device so it
is recorded in the original file. Alternately, film a clock, a newspaper
or say the date and time into the camera. Capture the location by
filming street signs, intersections and landmarks.

### 3. Document who is filming
Speak into the camera or keep a written record with the original video
file. If you need to be anonymous for security reasons, use a code name.

### 4. Film with intention
Record events as they happen from start to end. Hold your shots steady
and for at least 10 seconds. Move the camera very slowly and avoid
unnecessary zooming. Move closer when safe and possible. Film from
various viewpoints and angles to best capture the full context of the
incident.

### 5. Capture details
Capture details like police vehicles, uniforms, badges, indications of
police rank and their methods of communication. Capture other visual
records such as bullet holes, tear gas canisters and who was involved in
an incident.

### 6. Document those affected
People who are not engaged in hostilities are civilians and protected by
international law. Show if the victims were carrying weapons or acting
peacefully. Document who was affected and if they were specifically
targeted. If the victims were members of a targeted group, film
identifying details of the group such as badges or uniforms.

### 7. Contextualize with interviews or narration
Consider narrating while you are shooting to explain the situation. When
possible, add context to your video by interviewing consenting victims
or witnesses. Have them explain the details of the incident. Ensure
those you film are fully aware of how and where the video will be used.
When possible, discuss safety risks that may occur if the video is
shared publicly, online or with authorities.

### 8. Get good sound
Bad sound can ruin good video. When interviewing, move close to your
subject and choose a quiet place to record. Use an external microphone
or lavalier if possible.

### 9. Protect identities
If anonymity is needed, film intervieweesâ€™ hands while they speak, or
have the subject wrap their face in a scarf, adjust the focus to blur
the image or record crowds from behind. If revealing location could put
you or your subjects at risk, do not capture landmarks or other
identifying details.

### 10. Keep and organize your content
Always keep your original files and do not rename them. Organize your
footage and keep related, additional written documentation or reports
with your video files.

## 5 Tips for Filming Injuries and Casualties
### 1. Interviews
Try to get a doctor or medical professional to explain the injuries.
Their narration offers more credibility.

### 2. Details
Get close to the body to film injuries. Be slow and steady. Hold your
shots for at least 10 seconds. Avoid zooming or quick movements. Bring a
ruler or a common object such as a pencil to record the size and scope
of any injuries. If possible, take photos as they may capture clearer
details.

### 3. Context
Include shots of the entire body and the surrounding environment to
establish context. Capture various viewpoints and angles to show wounds,
bullet holes, bloodstains or related details.

### 4. Lighting
If filming outdoors, try not to cast a shadow on the subject. Also avoid
bright lights that overexpose the image. If indoors, set up lights to
support your filming.

### 5. Audience
When filming disturbing scenes or graphic images, keep your audience in
mind. If targeting media, ensure you meet broadcast standards by
recording additional footage from a few meters away and avoid close up
shots of graphic images.
